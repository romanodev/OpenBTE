Usage Examples
--------------

**Note:** This module is fully compatible with Node/Babel/ES6/ES5. Simply
omit the type declarations when using a language other than TypeScript.

**Recommended Design Patterns:**

Class authors should strive to maintain consistency in how their classes
expose signals to consumers. The PhosphorJS project has adopted a set of
conventions which cover signal naming and exposure. It is recommended for
third party libraries to adopt these same conventions in order to ensure
API consistency and maximal compatibility with libraries and meta tools
which rely on these conventions.

When defining a signal for use by instances of the **same** class:

  - Define the signal as a static member of the class.

  - Ensure the class type is used as the signal owner type.

  - Append the suffix `'Signal'` to the static member name.

  - Define a public getter which binds the static signal to
    the instance. This getter should contain no logic outside
    of binding the signal.

  - The name of the getter should be the same as the name of
    the static signal minus the `'Signal'` suffix.

  - Consumers should normally use the getter to access the signal,
    but meta tools and code generators are free to use the static
    API directly. This is why the getter must be a pure delegate
    as described above.

```typescript
import { ISignal, Signal } from 'phosphor-signaling';


class MyClass {

  static valueChangedSignal = new Signal<MyClass, number>();

  constructor(name: string) {
    this._name = name;
  }

  get valueChanged(): ISignal<MyClass, number> {
    return MyClass.valueChangedSignal.bind(this);
  }

  get name(): string {
    return this._name;
  }

  get value(): number {
    return this._value;
  }

  set value(value: number) {
    if (value !== this._value) {
      this._value = value;
      this.valueChanged.emit(value);
    }
  }

  private _name: string;
  private _value = 0;
}


class MyHandler {

  constructor(model: MyClass, name: string) {
    this._model = model;
    this._name = name;
    model.valueChanged.connect(this._onValueChanged, this);
  }

  dispose(): void {
    this._model.valueChanged.disconnect(this._onValueChanged, this);
    this._model = null;
  }

  private _onValueChanged(sender: MyClass, value: number): void {
    console.log(this._name, value);
  }

  private _name: string;
  private _model: MyClass;
}


function logger(sender: MyClass, value: number): void {
  console.log(sender.name, value);
}


var m1 = new MyClass('foo');
var m2 = new MyClass('bar');

m1.valueChanged.connect(logger);
m2.valueChanged.connect(logger);

var h1 = new MyHandler(m1, 'ham');
var h2 = new MyHandler(m2, 'eggs');

m1.value = 42;  // logs: foo 42, ham 42
m2.value = 17;  // logs: bar 17, eggs 17
```

When defining a signal for use by instances of a **different** class:

  - Define the signal as a static member of the class.

  - Ensure the instance type is used as the signal owner type.

  - Append the suffix `'Signal'` to the static member name.

  - Define a static method to get the bound signal for a particular
    instance of the owner type. This method should contain no logic
    outside of binding the signal.

  - Name the static method by prepending `'get'` to the capitalized
    signal name. Omit the `'Signal'` suffix.

  - Consumers should normally use the static method to access the
    bound signal, but meta tools and code generators are free to
    use the static API directly. This is why the method must be
    a pure delegate as described above.

This pattern is referred to as an *attached signal*. The signal is defined
by one class, but the sender is a foreign instance. This pattern is useful
when creating container objects which must emit signals for child objects
in a way which doesn't require polluting the child class with extraneous
signal definitions.

```typescript
class MyItem {
  // ...
}


class MyContainer {

  static valueChangedSignal = new Signal<MyItem, number>();

  static getValueChanged(item: MyItem): ISignal<MyItem, number> {
    return MyContainer.valueChangedSignal.bind(item);
  }

  getValue(item: MyItem): number {
    // ...
  }

  setValue(item: MyItem, value: number): void {
    // ...
    MyContainer.getValueChanged(item).emit(value);
  }
}
```

**Auxiliary API:**

```typescript
import {
  clearSignalData, disconnectReceiver, disconnectSender
} from 'phosphor-signaling';


// Disconnect a handler from all models in a single-shot.
disconnectReceiver(handler);

// Disconnect a particular model from all handlers in a single-shot.
disconnectSender(model);

// disconnect everything - sender *and* receiver
clearSignalData(model);
```
